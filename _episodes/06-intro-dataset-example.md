## Background: What is a CTD?

>> CTD stands for **conductivity, temperature, and depth**, and refers to a package of electronic instruments that measure these properties (see more about CTDs at  [https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/ctd.html](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/ctd.html)

CTDs can be moored and collect data while they are stationary. They can also be lowered and raised in the water column to create profiles of the water column.
