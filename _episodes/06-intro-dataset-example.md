Good data organization is the foundation of your research
project. Most researchers have data or do data entry in
spreadsheets. Spreadsheet programs are very useful graphical
interfaces for designing data tables and handling very basic data
quality control functions.

### Working with a Dataset from BCO-DMO

After this lesson, you will be able to:
- Apply best practices in data table formatting we learned in previous lessons
- Utilize basic quality control features and data manipulation practices
- Perform basic statistical analyses and plotting.
- Effectively export data from spreadsheet programs
- Learn the benefits and drawbacks to analyzing data in spreadsheets.
- Learn about other ways to analyze data other than spreadsheets.


### What this lesson will not teach you

- How to do more advanced *statistics* in a spreadsheet
- How to *write code* in spreadsheet programs

### Why aren't we teaching data analysis in spreadsheets

- Data analysis in spreadsheets usually requires a lot of manual
  work. If you want to change a parameter or run an analysis with a
  new dataset, you usually have to redo everything by hand. (We do
  know that you can create macros, but see the next point.)

- It is also difficult to track or reproduce statistical or plotting
  analyses done in spreadsheet programs when you want to go back to
  your work or someone asks for details of your analysis.
