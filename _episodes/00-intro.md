Good data organization is the foundation of your research project. Most researchers have data or do data entry in spreadsheets. Spreadsheet programs are very useful graphical interfaces for designing data tables and handling very basic data quality control functions.

### Part 1: Good approaches to Tabular Data Formatting

After this lesson, you will be able to:
- Implement best practices in data table formatting  
- Identify and address common formatting mistakes
- Understand approaches for handling dates in spreadsheets
- Utilize basic quality control features and data manipulation practices
- Effectively export data from spreadsheet programs

Spreadsheets are good for data entry. Therefore we have a lot of data
in spreadsheets. 
Much of your time as a researcher will be spent in this 'data wrangling' stage.
It's not the most fun, but it's necessary. We'll teach you how to think
about data organization and some practices for more effective data wrangling.



### Part 2: Working with a BCO-DMO Dataset 

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Apply best practices in data table formatting we learned in previous lessons
- Utilize basic quality control features and data manipulation practices
- Perform basic statistical analyses and plotting.
- Effectively export data from spreadsheet programs
- Learn the benefits and drawbacks to analyzing data in spreadsheets.
- Learn about other ways to analyze data other than spreadsheets.
